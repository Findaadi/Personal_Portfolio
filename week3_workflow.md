# Week 2: Workflow

## Exploring .NET MAUI

This week I got an exciting opportunity to familarize myself with C# and .NET MAUI. My task was to create a Notes app
that utilizes the SQLite Database. I worked on this app following the detailed instructions provided by Microsoft, that guided 
me towards the build of my first .NET MAUI app. 
You can access the tutorial here: [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/tutorials/notes-app/)

Upon completion, the notes app could save notes and allow the user to update them individually.

## Team Collaboration with GitHub

As per our module leader's instruction, our team has adapted the use of Github Flow for collaborating on a project. 
For more information on use of GitHub Flow by us for teamwork is to be found here: [Link]( https://github.com/wardliii/Green-Team/blob/main/WorkFlow.md)

## Addresing Assigned Issues

For the next task, we were provided with some issues to be resolved by every team member individually. We initially had to import the issues 
to our team project and the teammembers would assign to one each to fix them.
We imported the issues to our team project. I personally assigned myself to one of the issues from the backlog, and created a new branch for me to work on the issue.

## Workflow Interuption and Resolution

During this task, the team came accross an issue on the app due to which it stopped functioning. Due to this unexpected challenge, our 
workflow got disrupted and the team members including myself couldn't work on the issues that was assigned to us in
the expected timescale. However, at the last minute we managed to fix the app, allowing the team to work on their issue in their branches
moving forward. 

## Reflection

This weeks task was a quite challenging to understand at first. Due to my past modules not including the workings with GitHub and C#, it
was a challenge to get used to with this new way of working and collaborating with a team. 
This workflow surely is more of what an actual software engineering job would involve, which makes me excited to learn more about this and
gather most knowledge I can. 

The GitHub flow surely allowed us to effectively manage our tasks and project progress. Moving forward, I will be working
on the issue assigned to myself and resolve it on my branch. Overall, the tasks and challenges that came along this week has brought valuable
opportunity to learn and grow our individual knowledge and work together effectively as a team.
