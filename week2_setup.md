# Week 2: Setup

* This is the first week of classes for Software Engineering Module. 
* For this practical task, I have demostated the setup of my development environment I am working as a part of a team.
* In this module, I, along with my team will be using GitHub for code hosting, version control and collaboration, and Visual Studio as the IDE.
* We chose GitHub instead of alternatives such as Gitlab, Bitbucket or a self-hosted repository due to the ease of use,<br>
team members prior experience with this platform and per recommendation of our module leader. Along with this, the use of Visual Studio is as per the team's and module leader's chosen IDE instead of alternatives<br> 
such as Eclipse, Rider etc. 

## GitHub Setup

* In order to collaborate with the team, we required a shared GitHub repository. 		
  As a team, we decided a member of the team will create a shared GitHub repository for the team.
* Green Team Shared Github Repository:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## testing

setup

**DO**
test image: ![Test image!](https://github.com/Findaadi/Personal_Portfolio/blob/main/images/VSone.png)
* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
