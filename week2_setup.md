# Week 2: Setup

This is the first week of classes for Software Engineering Module. 
For this practical task, I have demostated the setup of my development environment I am working as a part of a team. <br><br>
In this module, I, along with my team will be using GitHub for code hosting, version control and collaboration, and Visual Studio as the IDE.
We chose GitHub instead of alternatives such as Gitlab, Bitbucket or a self-hosted repository due to the ease of use,		
team members prior experience with this platform and per recommendation of our module leader. Along with this, the use of Visual Studio is as per the team's and module leader's chosen IDE instead of alternatives
such as Eclipse, Rider etc. 

## GitHub Setup

* In order to collaborate with the team, we required a shared GitHub repository. 		
  As a team, we decided a member of the team will create a shared GitHub repository for the team. 
  We also created a Discord channel for our team for any form of communication relating to our team project. 
* Green Team Shared Github Repository:

* Along with this we also created a project board to track our tasks and their progress.

## Visual Studio 

Visual Studio IDE needs to be configured in order for me to contribute to the team project. 
I need to clone the repository from the shared GitHub, for which i have follwed the following steps:

* Upon startup of the IDE, click on "Clone a repository" as we need to get the code from GitHub.
