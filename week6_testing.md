# Testing

This week we were provided with a new repository by our module leader which was for a "Hangman" game. The objective of providing this repository
was to run test battles. The code for the game would run but there were functions we had to complete, and then had to create unit tests for those function
using Xunit framework. 

## Unit Test

The code I tested was for 'CheckLetterInWord' function which was a part of the Hangman game. This function is responsible for checking weather a user entered
letter is a part of the word they are guessing based on the game type i.e. easy, medium and hard. Its purpose is to accurately check the letters in the word for
the Hangman game. 

### Test Code

The practical exercise in week 6 involved competitive testing. For your portfolio entry,
select two pieces of test code that you wrote that best illustrate your skills in this
area.

For each example

* Summarise the purpose of the code you were testing
* Include the test code
* Provide a brief explanation of the test(s) that are performed
* Explain why this is an important aspect of the code to test
* Identify any limitations of your tests (this may be something that you realised after
  the evaluation).

Did you manage to write a test which failed during the final evaluation? If so, that would
make an excellent example. You should briefly discuss why the writer of the code might 
have overlooked the particular test case that failed.
