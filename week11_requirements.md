# Requirements specification

This item summarises your work in week 11 in which you elaborated a user story and developed
specification documentation for someone else to work on.

Your portfolio entry should

* Introduce the user story
* Briefly analyse the main difficulties for the developer
* Present your specification documentation (either in full or as extracts with links to
  the full documents as appropriate)
* Reflect on how your documentation compares to the material you have been working with
  so far. Have you made any improvements?
